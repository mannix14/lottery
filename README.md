# Powerball lottery

A better number generator. why?

Most lottery number generator generates numbers in one go. Powerball has 5 numebrs plus the special ball, which they generate random numbers on one shot. 

This one is generated individually. Like the first ball, the number generated is not from 1-65, only to a certain range of number. If you look at the history of winning  numbers, the first ball doesnt go over past a certain number, so why go all the way to 65. Less numbers to generate, the better chance of hitting it. So the same goes with the other balls, generate a number not from 1-65 but from the average range of what you see in the history of the drawings, example: the 5th number is 45-70.
